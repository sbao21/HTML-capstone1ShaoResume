<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<hr />
</p>
<h2>WeightLifting</h2>
</p>
<p>I like to pick up heavy things and put them down. Favoring the squat, deadlift, and the benchpress as my favorite exercises as they are both challenging to keep me engaged in the hobby and beneficial in building muscle.</p>
</p>
<h2>Cooking</h2>
</p>
<p>I prepare meals for the week every Friday so I have control over my diet from Mondays to Fridays. Being mindful about what you consume gives you a lot of control over your life. I routinely research new recipes to try out while balancing out meals that taste good and nutritious for you. It's very fun to learn about food and recipes.</p>
</p>
<h2>Anime</h2>
</p>
<p>I enjoy story rich anime with unique settings and characters. I've been a long term one piece fan, following the series since I was a kid. I enjoy shounens and action anime such
    <ul>
        <li>One Punch Man</li>
        <li>Overlord</li>
        <li>Bleach</li>
        <li>Demonslayer</li>
        <li>One Piece</li>
    </ul>
</p>
<h2>Gaming</h2>
</p>
<p>I play mostly indie, role playing and some co-op games with friends to unwind when I have time. Some of my favorites are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>KillingFloor</li>
        <li>Terraria</li>
        <li>Path of Exile</li>
        <li>League of Legends</li>
    </ul>
